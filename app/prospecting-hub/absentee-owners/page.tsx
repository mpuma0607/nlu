                        <span className="font-medium">Research Online Platforms:</span> Start with popular real estate
                        websites that allow FSBO listings, like Zillow, Craigslist, FSBO.com, and ForSaleByOwner.com.
                        These sites are frequently used by homeowners to list their properties directly.

                        Instagram, and Nextdoor can be useful. Look for local real estate groups or community pages
                        where homeowners might post FSBO listings.

                        <span className="font-medium">Drive Around Neighborhoods:</span> Take some time to drive through
                        local neighborhoods. Look for "For Sale By Owner" signs in yards. This method can uncover
                        listings that might not be advertised online.

                        Inform them that you're looking for FSBO properties. Word-of-mouth can be a powerful tool in
                        real estate.

                        <span className="font-medium">Check Local Newspapers:</span> Some sellers still use local
                        newspapers or community bulletins to advertise their properties. Regularly check these sources
                        for any new listings.

                        local real estate meetings. These can be great opportunities to learn about FSBO properties
                        before they hit the broader market.

                        listed their property yet.
